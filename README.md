# Raingauge

An online rain gauge over the past three days, using data from Weather.gov

## Limitations

* It only works for Sioux Falls, SD.
* It is only tested on an iPhone. See "Compatibility" below.

## Why

Because I often want to know.

## Suggested use

View from an iPhone and add to home screen.

## Compatibility

I wrote this to scratch an itch I had, and as such, only tested it on my iPhone 5. With minor changes, it should be able to work in any modern browser.

## Online

The app is available online at [http://raingauge.herokuapp.com](http://raingauge.herokuapp.com).
